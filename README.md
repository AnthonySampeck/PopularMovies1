# Popular Movies 1
This is the first project of Udacity's Android Nanodegree.  
It does the following:  
*Presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.  
*Allows the user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.  
*Allows the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information.  

This project demonstrates the ability to do the following:  
*Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.  
*Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.  
*Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code needed.
